          "q": "Is my voice really never uploaded?",
          "a": "100% yes. The AI model runs on your PC. Your microphone input is processed locally and never sent to any server. You can verify this by monitoring your network traffic or reviewing the open source code."
        },
        {
          "q": "What happens to my voice data after transcription?",
          "a": "You control it completely. Whisper Cheap stores transcriptions in local SQLite database on your PC. You can delete them anytime. We do not keep copies, backups, or access logs."

        {
          "q": "Can my employer monitor my dictation?",
          "a": "Only if your employer has direct access to your computer or network. Whisper Cheap does not send data to any company server, so no employer dashboard exists. Your dictation is invisible to anyone but you."

        {
          "q": "Is it HIPAA compliant?",
          "a": "Whisper Cheap itself is HIPAA-friendly because no data leaves your computer. However, HIPAA compliance depends on your overall setup. Consult with your compliance officer. The local nature of the software eliminates the biggest HIPAA risk: cloud storage."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does it collect usage analytics?",
          "a": "No. We do not track how often you use it, what you dictate, or where you use it. Zero telemetry, zero analytics, zero beacons."
        },
        {
          "q": "What if I uninstall the app?",
          "a": "All your local data (transcription history, settings, audio files) stays on your PC or gets deleted based on your preference. Nothing is synced to our servers because we do not have servers."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do I verify the app is truly private?",
          "a": "Check the source code on GitHub. Run a network monitoring tool (Wireshark) while using the app. You will see zero outbound connections to remote servers. The code is MIT licensed and auditable."
        },
        {
          "q": "What about future versions? Will privacy always be guaranteed?",
          "a": "Yes. Whisper Cheap is open source. If we ever added cloud features, the community would fork the project. Privacy is a core principle, not a feature."
